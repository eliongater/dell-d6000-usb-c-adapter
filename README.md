# dell-d6000-usb-c-adapter
KiCAD project to replace the proprietary USB-C cable

## Update (March 23, 2020):
This doesn't seem to work correctly. It negotiates USB alright but it might have a mismatched signal somewhere because USB 3.x is not enabling correctly. I don't have the time to debug this right now, so feel free to go ahead and fork it. :)

## Notice

I tried cleaning up this project before importing this to Github, so it might not load properly. Please submit an issue if you have trouble opening the project or loading any libraries!
